So when #tryandreview sent me a bottle of L‚ÄôOr√©al 3in1 extraordinary oil I couldn‚Äôt wait to try it and see its effects. I‚Äôd been looking for a hair treatment that I could use on dry hair before shampoo and had trouble finding one. So when I read that this could be used before shampoo to me this product had already won half the battle. I worked 10pumps of oil through my hair and left it in for about 15mins before shampooing it out. I applied another 2 more pumps after towel drying. The results was that my hair definitely felt softer though it didn‚Äôt do much for my frizz. But the comb definitely made its way through a lot easier.     The bottle design doesn‚Äôt really help in the pumping of the oil because you have to lift it up and angle it so that it doesn‚Äôt trickle down the sides. So if you have already worked the oil through your hair the first time to pump Loren product you‚Äôll have to pick up the bottle with oily hands or risk coating the bottle with more oil.,Volume (ml):100,5,28 Jun 2018,no

Usually, I don‚Äôt apply hair serum/oil to wet hair because most of the time before the product can successfully absorb by the hair, the water from my hair will transfer onto my hands first and I‚Äôll get this greasy oil-water texture on my palm, which I hate.

The lotion instantly hydrated my skin upon application.  Floral fragrant smell is nice with slightly thicker than water feel, takes a while to absorb into the skin and still leave slight sticky feeling even after padding but it's acceptable to me.  However it does not help to maintain the moisture long enough for me especially during the day as I have very dry skin condition.  Not as  effective for mature dry skin if you want to see immediate result.  But I am willing to continue using it and see if it does improve my dry skin condition after finishing the bottle.

A lightweight and non-greasy product that was v lightly fragranced.   My skin is both dehydrated and sensitive and I was initially worried that I might break out from using a new product or that this product would not be hydrating enough.   Both my fears were unfounded. I appreciated how quickly this product was absorbed into my skin, though I used 7-8 drops, more than the recommended 4-5 drops. A little really goes a long way- in the first three days, my face suffer from minor breakouts caused by using over 10 drops of the product each time. Once I decreased the amount, it was fine.     I used a magnifying mirror to examine my face before and after my skincare routinely and I‚Äôm pleased to discover that the fine lines looked less obvious with my skin looking more plumped up.

645,L-oreal-Paris,Foundation,Infallible Pro-Matte Liquid Foundation (24H Long Wear) by L'Or√©al Paris,$23.90, eagle from www.tryandreview.com,"This foundation definitely lived up to my expectations! (FYI my skin type i believe is more towards to oily side) In terms of coverage, I think it did a really good job of covering up my pimple scarring and areas of redness pretty well. Furthermore, the texture of the foundation was very lightweight on the skin even though coverage was high!

DARK EYE CIRCLE  3. Oily on the forehead,side of nose and dry on the cheek  4. Acne scars and blemishes    Previously I was using Maybelline Fitme before I received the free product from Try&Review. Thus, I would write this review in comparison to another drugstore matt poreless foundation Maybelline FITME.    After I have tried this Loreal foundation, I must say that I love it.  1. It is plastic light packing,easy to carry while Maybelline FITME is glass and heavy, I always needed handle the bottle with extra care.  2.  Squeezing the Loreal Foundation from the tube packing is easier to control than pouring out from the Maybelline glass bottle which often overflow. In addition to that, FITME often carelessly/accidentally pour out the foundation liquid when you tilt the bottle on the table.  3. Loreal's does not dry out my nose and mouth area while Maybelline FITME makes my look flaky, I often need to focus on my moisturizing process before I put on Maybelline's.  4. Despite Maybelline FITME has different skin shades, none of them fit perfectly to my skin tone. I am using shade 102 for Loreal and it fits perfectly.  5. Loreal's has higher coverage and the coverage is build-able. The photo shows my face after the first layer of the foundation. Usually I will use second layers on those prone areas, it works better than some concealers out there.    p.s I did not put any primers and skin care products in the photo, only blend the Loreal foundation with the beauty blender.",Color:103 - Natural Buff,5,02 Apr 2018,no

I have to try it with a pore filling primer and see how it goes. Coverage is medium. I don't recommend applying 2nd layer as it might look cakey.",Color:103 - Natural Buff,4,29 Mar 2018,no

My friend had also told me about how great the product was. Hence, when I was chosen for this test, I was beyond excited. I had received the shade 107 Fresh Beige which was sadly too dark for me. This shade had a slightly orange undertone which I was not excited about. Despite this, I decided to try out the product anyway to test out exactly how good the product was.    This foundation was very very smooth when I had applied it on. The formula provided coverage, yet it felt light and wasn't cakey. It was matte, yet you could still see the natural glow on your face, which was extraordinary as I had never had my hands on something so amazing. The foundation also didn't feel like it was drying out your face just because it was matte. After setting my face with translucent powder from Laura Mercier, as well as Urban Decay's setting spray, I headed out for my day of fun.    As the day passed, I realised I didn't even have to put more translucent powder as the foundation was amazing with oil control. It was only towards the end of the day where I started to get a tad oily. The foundation also didn't transfer much on clothing items.    All in all, this is an amazing product, and I would definitely recommend this to others. I would also purchase this foundation in my shade!",Color:103 - Natural Buff,5,28 Mar 2018,no

I was truly honoured to be given an opportunity to review the new product by L‚ÄôOr√©al. L‚ÄôOr√©al infallible pro-matte foundation is a 24-hr Demi-matte cover foundation. The shade that was sent to my mailbox was 107-Fresh beige which happens to be the closest shade to my skin tone. As I blend in the foundation, I felt like heaven. It was so smooth and light that I didn‚Äôt even felt like I had foundation on. The medium coverage foundation helped to cover my acne scars and dark circles which I usually use a concealer to cover. In that aspect, the coverage for this foundation is really good. To finish off the whole look, I dabbed some loose powder, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick and blusher. (That‚Äôs what I normally apply when heading to work - with concealer). Having the thought of one less product to use on my face makes me a happy person.

702,L-oreal-Paris,Foundation,Infallible Pro-Matte Liquid Foundation (24H Long Wear) by L'Or√©al Paris,$23.90, mikasam from www.tryandreview.com,"Been using this for almost a week now, for both my gig and work.    Ease of application: 8/10  The consistency of this foundation is described on the packaging as 'creamy', but I for one feel that it is a lot more fluid, and the consistency is very similar to that of Lanc√¥me's Absolue Foundation, which is close to watery, making it easy to apply, and it dries fast as well. After putting it on, it felt like I was wearing nothing on my face, because of how thin the foundation is. The duration of applying the product is very quick as it's really thin and glides on easily to the skin.   Coverage: 9/10  For such a thin foundation, the coverage is actually really high. It can cover up pores and also acne redness (still a good idea to use a colour corrector primer before using the foundation tho, I used W7's Green Prime Magic to neutralise my acne redness). And also, the coverage is also buildable. But do not expect this foundation alone to cover up moles or any dark brown spots on the face. Would be better to layer on some concealer on moles.   Lasting ability: 7/10  I myself have oily skin, and by midday during work (5-6 hours after applying), the foundation has almost melted off completely, which is kinda expected. Doing a touch up with more foundation will only decrease the existing tints life span, so try not to do touchup with this foundation. So for users with oily skin or combination skin, please don't expect this foundation to stay on your face the whole day.  For dry skin users, you won't have to worry about the foundation melting off, but then again, it is a matte finish foundation, so it's already pretty dry. Try to get a hydrating foundation instead.    Is it worth the price? For one 30ml tube of foundation that costs $29.90, it's quite a good deal. It has medium to high coverage, and is such a thin matte foundation. Ruling out the average lasting ability on oily skin users, this foundation is actually a good steal.    #FaceOfTheDay",Color:103 - Natural Buff,4,26 Mar 2018,no

Consistency's quite light, but you have to properly moisturise your skin, else it'd apply cakey and patchy. Also, you have to work in sections as it dries quite fast. Provides medium coverage for me as I still needed concealer for my under eyes and blemishes.     Used this for over 10 hours and it controlled the oil quite well.

With light application, the effect was somewhat a blend - fine enough to be smoothed over your face without the cakey feeling, substantial enough to be used as a base over open pores. Works to provide a matte effect on oily or well-moisturised areas, but not for dry or flaky areas, which tend to be accentuated. Did not feel that it lasted for 16 hours as claimed; definitely needs touch up, especially when you get warm or sweaty. 

If you are particular about the casing, this, though functional and lightweight, felt cheap. The double-sided case was well-intended (separates applicator and powder), but handling it felt forced.

Powder is airy, smooth and matte. It's also very natural and provide some coverage. Can be use by itself on good skin days. 

Design is very compact and lightweight. Comes with mirror. 

The only downside for me is the puff. Other than being able to apply the powder as per normal and it is soft, the design of the puff looks like those once off disposable ones.  Thus it makes me doubt the quality and durability. I feel it didn't matched the brand image and hope it can be improved.

I love how the powder creates a natural look and the best part? It does not give the scary cakey look! Its ultra-fine texture blends into my BB cream seamlessly and creates a poreless and porcelain alike skin. The powder does a great job in keeping my make up in place for long hours.

So just be very gentle on spray nozzle, spray little, comb as fast as you can to spread colour if you have more grey hairs. Magic is it keeps hair soft. Non transferable to hands or clothes. No reaction to my skull and hairline. Washed off completely in 2nd wash but still not transferable to towel after first wash.

I started using the spray almost immediately as my grey roots were already showing and I did not have the time or energy to dye my hair.  I had tried other touch up sprays before but they were not effective.  I was pleasantly surprised that L'Oreal spray covered all my grey roots effectively and although it left a stain on my fingers if I touched the retouch area, the colour stayed put and did not come off,  I had bought the dark brown colour which I thought was a better match for my hair colour than the sample brown colour I received as a tester.  However, both colours were still alright for me and this product saves me a lot of time as I do not need to dye my hair roots so often and as such, my hair does not dry out so easily.","Volume (ml):75, Color Family:Golden Brown",5,08 Nov 2018,no
