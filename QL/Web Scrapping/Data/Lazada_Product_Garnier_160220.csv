- The sheet mask fits my face contour and stays well -I tried walking around with it to check if the edges of the mask will pop-up but luckily it did not. 
- Effect of the mask was good. I did a blackhead extraction (which left parts of my face reddish and irritated) before putting the mask on. Upon removing the mask after 15mins, the irritated part on my face were calmed and the redness has subside mostly. I think it does help to restore skin cells as it claims. 
- This could be a SOS mask if your skin feels irritated and dry. 
- You can start with this if you are new to sheet mask.

- I am slightly uncomfortable with the mask having a plastic-y scent. (I initially thought it was expired but glad to find out it wasn't)

But that particular brand when i have used, the sticky feeling exist, so i have to rinse to get rid of the feeling ok my face. For garnier, its not though. Amazing!

I have been a light makeup for 3years now. Before that i used to have heavy makeup on).  Secondly, it mentioned its for sensitive skin. I have this sensitivity issue under my eyes & nose area, for years now. Yesterday night, tried and tested. And IM LOVING IT! I don't feel the tingling heaty on my sensitive areas though. And best best, after removing it, you can just straightaway go to bed. Really! No need to rinse after removing. Wow Garnier. I have used other brand, which is have been my fave. But that particular brand when i have used, the sticky feeling exist, so i have to rinse to get rid of the feeling ok my face. For garnier, its not though. Amazing!
