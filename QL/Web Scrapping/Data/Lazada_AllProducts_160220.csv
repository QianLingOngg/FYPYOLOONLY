So when #tryandreview sent me a bottle of L‚ÄôOr√©al 3in1 extraordinary oil I couldn‚Äôt wait to try it and see its effects. I‚Äôd been looking for a hair treatment that I could use on dry hair before shampoo and had trouble finding one. So when I read that this could be used before shampoo to me this product had already won half the battle. I worked 10pumps of oil through my hair and left it in for about 15mins before shampooing it out. I applied another 2 more pumps after towel drying. The results was that my hair definitely felt softer though it didn‚Äôt do much for my frizz. But the comb definitely made its way through a lot easier.     The bottle design doesn‚Äôt really help in the pumping of the oil because you have to lift it up and angle it so that it doesn‚Äôt trickle down the sides. So if you have already worked the oil through your hair the first time to pump Loren product you‚Äôll have to pick up the bottle with oily hands or risk coating the bottle with more oil.,Volume (ml):100,5,28-Jun-18,no

236,L-oreal-Paris,Hair Conditioner,L'Oreal Paris Fall Repair Rapid Reviver Conditioner,$7.43 , Shelly111 from www.tryandreview.com,I‚Äôve always been obsessed with hair conditioners and always keen to try new products to keep my crown looking smooth and shiny.  I used the L‚ÄôOREAL PARIS FALL RESIST X3 RAPID REVIVER for a week and to my experience my hair became smooth and glossy after use without the greasy effect (and lo and behold it has no leave on time which makes it easy and fast).  Though one of my major concerns is to fight hair fall which I find this product good to try on. And I think it has minimized my hair fall but only to about 10-20% less. Maybe it may require longer usage of the product to reap its benefits to what I‚Äôm expecting.

The lotion instantly hydrated my skin upon application.  Floral fragrant smell is nice with slightly thicker than water feel, takes a while to absorb into the skin and still leave slight sticky feeling even after padding but it's acceptable to me.  However it does not help to maintain the moisture long enough for me especially during the day as I have very dry skin condition.  Not as  effective for mature dry skin if you want to see immediate result.  But I am willing to continue using it and see if it does improve my dry skin condition after finishing the bottle.

A lightweight and non-greasy product that was v lightly fragranced.   My skin is both dehydrated and sensitive and I was initially worried that I might break out from using a new product or that this product would not be hydrating enough.   Both my fears were unfounded. I appreciated how quickly this product was absorbed into my skin, though I used 7-8 drops, more than the recommended 4-5 drops. A little really goes a long way- in the first three days, my face suffer from minor breakouts caused by using over 10 drops of the product each time. Once I decreased the amount, it was fine.     I used a magnifying mirror to examine my face before and after my skincare routinely and I‚Äôm pleased to discover that the fine lines looked less obvious with my skin looking more plumped up.

The 7-day challenge really makes my face glowing and even my neck becomes flawless. Supple skin and I have no issues at all on my face when red days come. I have no breakouts that was not normal for me, especially when red days was still on or even if its over. Using it twice a day really makes my face and neck looks healthy and radiant.

DARK EYE CIRCLE  3. Oily on the forehead,side of nose and dry on the cheek  4. Acne scars and blemishes    Previously I was using Maybelline Fitme before I received the free product from Try&Review. Thus, I would write this review in comparison to another drugstore matt poreless foundation Maybelline FITME.    After I have tried this Loreal foundation, I must say that I love it.  1. It is plastic light packing,easy to carry while Maybelline FITME is glass and heavy, I always needed handle the bottle with extra care.  2.  Squeezing the Loreal Foundation from the tube packing is easier to control than pouring out from the Maybelline glass bottle which often overflow. In addition to that, FITME often carelessly/accidentally pour out the foundation liquid when you tilt the bottle on the table.  3. Loreal's does not dry out my nose and mouth area while Maybelline FITME makes my look flaky, I often need to focus on my moisturizing process before I put on Maybelline's.  4. Despite Maybelline FITME has different skin shades, none of them fit perfectly to my skin tone. I am using shade 102 for Loreal and it fits perfectly.  5. Loreal's has higher coverage and the coverage is build-able. The photo shows my face after the first layer of the foundation. Usually I will use second layers on those prone areas, it works better than some concealers out there.    p.s I did not put any primers and skin care products in the photo, only blend the Loreal foundation with the beauty blender.",Color:103 - Natural Buff,5,2-Apr-18,no

This shade had a slightly orange undertone which I was not excited about. Despite this, I decided to try out the product anyway to test out exactly how good the product was.    This foundation was very very smooth when I had applied it on. The formula provided coverage, yet it felt light and wasn't cakey. It was matte, yet you could still see the natural glow on your face, which was extraordinary as I had never had my hands on something so amazing. The foundation also didn't feel like it was drying out your face just because it was matte. After setting my face with translucent powder from Laura Mercier, as well as Urban Decay's setting spray, I headed out for my day of fun.    As the day passed, I realised I didn't even have to put more translucent powder as the foundation was amazing with oil control.

In that aspect, the coverage for this foundation is really good. To finish off the whole look, I dabbed some loose powder, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick and blusher. (That‚Äôs what I normally apply when heading to work - with concealer). Having the thought of one less product to use on my face makes me a happy person.

661,L-oreal-Paris,Foundation,Infallible Pro-Matte Liquid Foundation (24H Long Wear) by L'Or√©al Paris,$23.90 , mikasam from www.tryandreview.com,"Been using this for almost a week now, for both my gig and work.    Ease of application: 8/10  The consistency of this foundation is described on the packaging as 'creamy', but I for one feel that it is a lot more fluid, and the consistency is very similar to that of Lanc√¥me's Absolue Foundation, which is close to watery, making it easy to apply, and it dries fast as well. After putting it on, it felt like I was wearing nothing on my face, because of how thin the foundation is. The duration of applying the product is very quick as it's really thin and glides on easily to the skin.   Coverage: 9/10  For such a thin foundation, the coverage is actually really high. It can cover up pores and also acne redness (still a good idea to use a colour corrector primer before using the foundation tho, I used W7's Green Prime Magic to neutralise my acne redness). And also, the coverage is also buildable. But do not expect this foundation alone to cover up moles or any dark brown spots on the face. Would be better to layer on some concealer on moles.   Lasting ability: 7/10  I myself have oily skin, and by midday during work (5-6 hours after applying), the foundation has almost melted off completely, which is kinda expected. Doing a touch up with more foundation will only decrease the existing tints life span, so try not to do touchup with this foundation. So for users with oily skin or combination skin, please don't expect this foundation to stay on your face the whole day.  For dry skin users, you won't have to worry about the foundation melting off, but then again, it is a matte finish foundation, so it's already pretty dry. Try to get a hydrating foundation instead.    Is it worth the price? For one 30ml tube of foundation that costs $29.90, it's quite a good deal. It has medium to high coverage, and is such a thin matte foundation. Ruling out the average lasting ability on oily skin users, this foundation is actually a good steal.    #FaceOfTheDay",Color:103 - Natural Buff,4,26-Mar-18,no

Provides medium coverage for me as I still needed concealer for my under eyes and blemishes.     Used this for over 10 hours and it controlled the oil quite well. It wasn't super matte but my face wasn't an oil slick either. Could get away with just blotting the oily patches tbh.     Overall, quite a good foundation for oily skin!",Color:103 - Natural Buff,4,25-Mar-18,no

I have received the foundation in the shade of Natural Beige (105). The shade is quite close to my skin colour.  And good that it has so many dfiferent shade to choose from.  The product is like advertise, light and matt.  Coverage is still ok as I have many acne scars, and it did not cover all. Also maybe due to my oily skin, it did not last as long.

With light application, the effect was somewhat a blend - fine enough to be smoothed over your face without the cakey feeling, substantial enough to be used as a base over open pores. Works to provide a matte effect on oily or well-moisturised areas, but not for dry or flaky areas, which tend to be accentuated. Did not feel that it lasted for 16 hours as claimed; definitely needs touch up, especially when you get warm or sweaty.

Extremely handy bottle to keep either in your dressing table or in handbag. Take out 5 seconds from your busy schedule to get trendy chik coloured hairs. Yes you read right, 5 seconds only because after spraying it dries in 5 seconds only. So just be very gentle on spray nozzle, spray little, comb as fast as you can to spread colour if you have more grey hairs. Magic is it keeps hair soft. Non transferable to hands or clothes. No reaction to my skull and hairline. Washed off completely in 2nd wash but still not transferable to towel after first wash.

- The sheet mask fits my face contour and stays well -I tried walking around with it to check if the edges of the mask will pop-up but luckily it did not. 
- Effect of the mask was good. I did a blackhead extraction (which left parts of my face reddish and irritated) before putting the mask on. Upon removing the mask after 15mins, the irritated part on my face were calmed and the redness has subside mostly. I think it does help to restore skin cells as it claims. 
- This could be a SOS mask if your skin feels irritated and dry. 
- You can start with this if you are new to sheet mask. 

Cons:
- I am slightly uncomfortable with the mask having a plastic-y scent. (I initially thought it was expired but glad to find out it wasn't)

Moreover, the tip is sharp, which gives a high ease when trying to colour the corners of the lips. However, the tip tends to be a bit hard as well.     Shortly after applying I felt that the ink is abit sticky on the lips, which went away after a while.  It is surprisingly very transfer proof, as it did not come off when I tried to rub it off with my fingers. However, when I tried to remove it with my make up remover, some of  the product stayed on my lips. Not sure if the product is too strong or the make up remover (water based) is weak.

I've been looking for a lip color that stays and this one really does the job.. it does accentuate the dry lines on my lips to a mild extent and also be sure to exfoliate the dead skin on your lips before applying this.

This does NOT come off even with Dettol/ Life Bouy soap! As clearly seen in the photos, after soaping, rubbing, scrubbing it on my hand after the hand swatch, this DOES not come off. Unbelievable. But that's exactly what ALL lipsticks should be.     2) Formula is ALSO better than Kylie J's - more fluid (greater for beginners) when applied, compared to Kylie's which is more creamy.     Verdict: Move over Kylie Liquid Lipsticks. This Maybelline Matte Ink is taking over!    Cons:  1) Slightly Sticky when applied on hand for swatch. However, this is not as apparent when on hand. :)    2) More range of colours please!   I wore the shade of No. 15 Lover, which reminds me alot like Kylie Jenner's liquid lipstick in Shade POSIE K. This may suit better on cool & fair skin tones.

I have tons of reason to love it!     - it‚Äôs quick drying and transferproof.   - it‚Äôs sticky before it‚Äôs dries BUT its normal for a matte lippies.   - it has a velvet felt when u first applied BUT has a silky felt after. ( i even tried using lip balm over it and it‚Äôs okay!)   - Not only it‚Äôs pigmented and has vibrant colour, the one i received (creator) is a purple but has pink undertone and even after a greasy dinner i had it fade off and left a tint! Which is great  - The applicator of it‚Äôs great for matte lippies as i can outline my lips with it.     The only concern i have was, removing it. But there‚Äôs a specific ‚Äúeraser‚Äù for it.
