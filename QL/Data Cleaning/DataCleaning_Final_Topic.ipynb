      "2 this foundation definitely lived up to my expectations! (fyi my skin type i believe is more towards to oily side) in terms of coverage, i think it did a really good job of covering up my pimple scarring and areas of redness pretty well. furthermore, the texture of the foundation was very lightweight on the skin even though coverage was high! in terms of lasting power, i managed to get a solid 6 hours of wear before the foundation starting moving/separating on my skin. also, the foundation definitely helped with oil control as there was much less shine in my t-zone area, in comparison to other foundations i use. overall, would highly recommend this product, especially for those with combination/oily skin :)\n",

      "been using this for almost a week now, for both my gig and work.    ease of application: 8/10  the consistency of this foundation is described on the packaging as 'creamy', but i for one feel that it is a lot more fluid, and the consistency is very similar to that of lancôme's absolue foundation, which is close to watery, making it easy to apply, and it dries fast as well. after putting it on, it felt like i was wearing nothing on my face, because of how thin the foundation is. the duration of applying the product is very quick as it's really thin and glides on easily to the skin.   coverage: 9/10  for such a thin foundation, the coverage is actually really high. it can cover up pores and also acne redness (still a good idea to use a colour corrector primer before using the foundation tho, i used w7's green prime magic to neutralise my acne redness). and also, the coverage is also buildable. but do not expect this foundation alone to cover up moles or any dark brown spots on the face. would be better to layer on some concealer on moles.   lasting ability: 7/10  i myself have oily skin, and by midday during work (5-6 hours after applying), the foundation has almost melted off completely, which is kinda expected. doing a touch up with more foundation will only decrease the existing tints life span, so try not to do touchup with this foundation. so for users with oily skin or combination skin, please don't expect this foundation to stay on your face the whole day.  for dry skin users, you won't have to worry about the foundation melting off, but then again, it is a matte finish foundation, so it's already pretty dry. try to get a hydrating foundation instead.    is it worth the price? for one 30ml tube of foundation that costs $29.90, it's quite a good deal. it has medium to high coverage, and is such a thin matte foundation. ruling out the average lasting ability on oily skin users, this foundation is actually a good steal.    #faceoftheday\n",

      "i’ve got this product last sunday, and i tried it for 2 days.( yes, i always tried new products for 2 days, trying to experiment and make the product work for me. lol)  first day- i tried it with my trusted make up products (primer, setting powder and setting spray) first application i already love the shade, its a perfect match for me but i know this won’t work for me as it feels dry and tacky. it made the dry area of my face patchy but on t-zone it’s perfectly fine. (anyway i have combi skin)  but the wear time of this foundation is really amazing. it does stay at it is for 15 hours.  2nd day- i tried it with all my moisturising/hydrating products (moisturiser, primer and hydrating mist) but still didn’t work for me. i really wanted to love this foundation as i love the shade, coverage and the wear time. it’s really amazing product but it didn’t work out with my combination skin. i guess this will work perfectly with oily skin type.\n",
